# Yendoria

A traditional tile-based roguelike game built with Python and libtcod, featuring ASCII graphics, turn-based gameplay, and procedural dungeon generation.

## Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Turn-based gameplay**: Player and monster actions alternate in turns
- **ASCII graphics**: Traditional roguelike visual style using character-based graphics
- **Field of view**: Dynamic lighting system with 8-tile radius revealing map as you explore
- **Exploration system**: Tiles become "explored" once seen and remain visible in darker colors
- **Combat system**: Melee combat with health and damage mechanics (planned feature)

### Map Generation
- **Procedural dungeons**: Randomly generated levels with rooms and corridors
- **Room-based design**: Connected rectangular rooms with L-shaped corridors
- **Collision detection**: Proper wall and entity collision handling
- **Configurable generation**: Max 30 rooms, sizes between 6x6 and 10x10

### Entity System
- **Component-based architecture**: Flexible ECS (Entity Component System) design
- **Player character**: Controllable '@' character with health and movement
- **Monster AI**: Basic AI for orcs and trolls (AI system ready for implementation)
- **Health system**: Hit points and damage mechanics (entities have health components)
- **Graphics system**: Customizable character representation and colors

### Input & Controls
- **Multiple input schemes**: Arrow keys, WASD, vim keys, and numpad support
- **Responsive controls**: Smooth movement and action handling
- **Escape to quit**: Standard exit mechanism

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Poetry (for dependency management)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd yendoria
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Game
Start the game with:
```bash
poetry run python -m yendoria
```

Or use the VS Code task:
- Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux)
- Type "Tasks: Run Task"
- Select "Run Yendoria"

### Controls
- **Movement**: Arrow keys, WASD, vim keys (hjkl), or numpad (including diagonals)
- **Exploration**: Move to reveal new areas within field of view
- **Quit**: Press Escape or close the window

### Gameplay
1. Use movement keys to explore the dungeon
2. The '@' symbol represents your character
3. 'o' represents orcs, 'T' represents trolls
4. Dark blue areas are unexplored walls, lighter areas are explored
5. Your field of view illuminates an 8-tile radius around you
6. Explore all rooms to map out the dungeon!

## Architecture

### Component System
The game uses an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture:

- **Entities**: Containers for components (Player, Orc, Troll)
- **Components**: Data containers (Position, Health, Graphic, AI)
- **Systems**: Logic processors (Rendering, Input handling)

### Key Modules
- `engine.py`: Main game loop and coordination
- `game_map/`: Map generation and tile management
- `entities/`: Entity creation and management
- `components/`: ECS component definitions
- `systems/`: Game systems (rendering, etc.)
- `input_handlers/`: Input processing
- `utils/constants.py`: Game configuration and constants

## Development

### Running Tests
Execute the test suite:
```bash
poetry run pytest
```

Run tests with coverage:
```bash
poetry run pytest --cov=yendoria
```
